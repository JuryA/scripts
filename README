TunMgrd -- An SSH connection management daemon.


ABOUT

tunmgrd is a daemon that you use to bring up and keep up SSH connections and
the forwarding you set up through them.

I've had a really hard time finding a quality product that did this for me in
a portable and sane manner.  In the end, I decided I'd be better off writing
it myself.  The focus of tunmgrd is:

    - Good and safe code
    - Extensive configurability
    - Clear and correct documentation
    - Useful reporting
    - Useful client utilities to interact with the daemon
