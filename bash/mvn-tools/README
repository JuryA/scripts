Mvn-Tools -- Maven management tools.


ABOUT

mvn-tools is a collection of utilities for working with maven repositories and
java web application distributions.

    - mvn-auto:     Build only the Maven artifacts in a multi-module project that
                    have been modified since the last build.
                    Compares the mtime of each file in src/ against the jar/war/ear/zip
                    file in target/ to determine whether the artifact is outdated.
    - mvn-install:  Add a Java archive or ZIP as an artifact to the local repository.
                    The script asks you for all required information.
    - mvn-meta:     Maintains a tree that caches hashes of repository files.
                    Primarily a library; used by mvn-web.
    - mvn-release:  Generate releases for your artifacts, deploy and tag/branch in GIT.
                    Uses maven-release-plugin and works best when you extract all versions
                    of project artifacts out of your pom.xml's (except from <parent>).
    - mvn-sync:     Uses rsync to synchronize your local repository with a remote one
                    for building remotely.
    - mvn-tools:    Installer / library for the framework.
    - mvn-web:      Used to manage live extracted files from JBoss to a safe location
                    where you can easily edit and see live changes.  Also allows you to
                    apply your edits to these files back onto your repository.
